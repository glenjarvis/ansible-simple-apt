    Use low-level package objects in the apt module to check installed state

    Packages which are half-installed are not adequately represented by
    the .is_installed field of the apt.package.Package object. By using the
    lower-level apt_pkg.Package object (which provides the .current_state
    field), we can check for a partially-installed state more accurately.

    Fixes #3421
